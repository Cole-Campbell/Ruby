	This helloWorld file will focus the development of methods in Ruby.

	A method must be defined in Ruby, this is done through the use of 'def'.
	To close a method, you must use 'end'.

	To use the function, call the method which will then run the function.

	The method takes a value of anything and will present the text provided
	after calling the method.
=end

def hello(anything)
	puts anything
end

hello "This is extra text"
hello "And I am not an imp"
hello "Or are you an imp?"
